    <p>
        The bank made a drastic change in the rules of LPG gas subsidy saying that now LPG gas subsidy will not go to the bank account of those people whose account balance does not have at least ₹ 3000.

        Due to non-availability of LPG gas subsidy, recently people had complained a lot to the gas agency. There was also a complaint that due to the minimum amount, penalty is also being deducted from their bank account, earlier LPG gas subsidy used to come regularly in the account but now due to minimum amount from few months LPG gas subsidy in the account. It does not come and money is also deducted by the banks in the name of penalty.
    </p>
    <h3>trouble caused by</h3>
    <p>Let us tell you that the reason behind this is a directive issued by the Modi government a few days ago, according to the victory, if you have less than ₹ 3000 in your account then you will not get LPG gas subsidy.

        You must remember that a few days ago, the central government had distributed many LPG gas connections for free under the Ujjwala scheme, as well as in the category of subsidy, those who already have gas connections but their The economic condition is weak. Due to which the government decided to give LPG gas cylinder subsidy to these poor sections.</p>
    <h4>Bank accounts can be re-activated in this way</h4>
    <p>However, after opening crores of bank accounts across the country, and now after the government directive, due to no transaction in the account, it has been deactivated due to which you are not able to get the subsidy of your LPG gas cylinder. Also, under Jan Dhan Yojana, many accounts were opened at the same time on which no transaction took place and they have also been deactivated, so you can go to your bank and activate your accounts by giving Pune Aadhaar and some necessary documents. You can get it done and get your LPG gas subsidy in your account.</p>
   
  
    <h4>Large number of inactive accounts</h4>
    <p>The administration had opened large amount of Jan Dhan accounts, and LPG gas subsidy was also being given in these accounts, but at present many accounts of Jan Dhan have become active, due to which LPG gas subsidy is being given in these accounts. By not reaching the accounts, it gets stuck in the bank itself, now it is your responsibility to make sure that your account is active or closed.</p>
